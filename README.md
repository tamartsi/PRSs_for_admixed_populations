# PRSs_for_admixed_populations

These files provide SNPs (rsIDs, chromosomes, and positions in genome build 37), alleles, 
and weights, for constructing PRSs for 12 traits: 
Height
BMI
HIP (hip circumferene)
WHR (waist-to-hip ratio)
WC (waist circumference)
PLT (platelet count)
HGB (hemoglobin concentration)
WBC (white blood cell count)
SBP (systolic blood pressure)
DBP (diastolic blood pressure)
MAP (mean arterial pressure)
PP (pulse pressure)
In admixed population of Hispanic/Latino and African Americans. 
PRSs were constructed based on results from independent GWAS in European Ancestry studies, 
and the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, and validated in the Women Health Initiative.
